# Install Jenkins, configure Docker as agent, set up cicd, deploy applications to k8s.

## AWS EC2 Instance

- Go to AWS Console
- Instances(running)
- Launch instances

### Install Jenkins.

Pre-Requisites:
 - Java (JDK)

### Run the below commands to install Java and Jenkins

Install Java

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
```

Verify Java is Installed

```
java -version
```

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

```
sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

**Note: ** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.

- EC2 > Instances > Click on <Instance-ID>
- In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
- Security groups
- Add inbound traffic rules ( just allow TCP 8080 as well,I allowed `All traffic`).


### Login to Jenkins using the below URL:

http://<ec2-instance-public-ip-address>:8080   

Note: If you are not interested in allowing `All Traffic` to your EC2 instance
      1. Delete the inbound traffic rule for your instance
      2. Edit the inbound traffic rule to only allow custom TCP port `8080`
  
After login to Jenkins, 
      - Run the command to copy the Jenkins Admin Password - `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
      - Enter the Administrator password
      

### Click on Install suggested plugins

Wait for the Jenkins to Install suggested plugins

Create First Admin User or Skip the step [If you want to use this Jenkins instance for future use-cases as well, better to create admin user]

Jenkins Installation is Successful

## Install the Docker Pipeline plugin in Jenkins:

   - Log in to Jenkins.
   - Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
   - In the Available tab, search for "Docker Pipeline".
   - Select the plugin and click the Install button.
   - Restart Jenkins after the plugin is installed.
   

Wait for the Jenkins to be restarted.


## Docker Slave Configuration

Run the below command to Install Docker

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```
 
### Grant Jenkins user and Ubuntu user permission to docker deamon.

```
sudo su - 
usermod -aG docker jenkins
usermod -aG docker ubuntu
systemctl restart docker
```

Once you are done with the above steps, it is better to restart Jenkins.

```
http://<ec2-instance-public-ip>:8080/restart
```

The docker agent configuration is now successful.
